## Online Shop using PostgreSQL
## Description

This is a Node.js application using Express and PostgreSQL. This project includes user authentication, session management, file upload functionality with Multer, and integration with the Stripe API for payments. This was milestone project with MongoDb as Database in the 100 Days of Web Development by Academind. But I implemented this project using PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB.
This Repo is deployment ready. I have used free tier of neon to host postgres and this express app is hosted on render.com .
